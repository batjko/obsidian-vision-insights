### Key Technologies

- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **OpenAI API v5** - Vision analysis capabilities
- **Obsidian API** - Native plugin integration
- **ESBuild** - Fast compilation and bundling

### Build Scripts

```bash
npm run dev        # Development build with watch mode
npm run build      # Production build
npm run release    # Create release package
```

### Release Process

This plugin uses semantic versioning. To create a new release:

**Interactive Release**
```bash
npm run release
```
This will prompt you to select the type of version bump (patch, minor, or major).

**Direct Release**
```bash
npm run release:patch   # For bug fixes (1.0.0 → 1.0.1)
npm run release:minor   # For new features (1.0.0 → 1.1.0)  
npm run release:major   # For breaking changes (1.0.0 → 2.0.0)
```

The release script will:
1. Bump the version in `package.json`, `manifest.json`, and `versions.json`
2. Build the plugin
3. Commit and tag the changes
4. Push to GitHub
5. Create a GitHub release with the built assets

**Manual Release**
If you need to release the current version without bumping:
```bash
node scripts/release.mjs skip
```

### Contributing

1. The usual: Fork and submit a pull request
2. Try to stick to the existing conventions.
3. KISS

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Plugin won't load**
- Check Obsidian version compatibility (minimum 0.15.0)
- Verify all files are in the correct plugin directory
- Check browser console for error messages

**API key errors**
- Ensure API key is correctly entered without extra spaces
- Verify API key has sufficient credits and permissions
- Test connection using the built-in test button

**Image detection fails**
- Check image file exists and is accessible
- Verify image format is supported
- Try different image syntax formats

**Slow analysis**
- Check internet connection
- Consider using faster model (GPT-4.1 Mini)
- Adjust rate limiting settings if needed

## Privacy & Security

- **API Key Storage** - Stored locally in Obsidian's plugin data
- **Image Processing** - Images sent to OpenAI for analysis according to their privacy policy
- **No Telemetry** - Plugin doesn't collect or transmit usage data
